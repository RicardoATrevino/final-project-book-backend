front end ^^


ruby on rails



## Installation

```bash
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

## Usage

```bash
rails server
```

You can run all the API tests from the `test` folder by running: 

```bash
rails test
```
 i wrote about half of the tests with little to no help. the rest were fully assisted. yes the ones that fail are the ones i wrote lol
 ```
note, i have not looked at the tests since like, basically day 2 of this project which was well over a week ago and it is now May 12, 2024, so I could be wrong on my aproximation of how much help i got on the tests but 100% i did hand write some tests.
```


## Roadmap

List any ideas you plan on implementing in the future.
